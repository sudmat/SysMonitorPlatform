# A System Monitor Platform Based On Collectd
## Installation
Clone this repository and make sure to install the following dependencies (you will need Python for this deployment):
- [webgme](https://webgme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/dependencies.html)
- [collcetd](https://collectd.org)
- [collectd-web](https://www.tecmint.com/install-collectd-and-collectd-web-to-monitor-server-resources-in-linux)

Second, start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`).

Make sure all node-modules are installed (`npm install`), then, run `npm start` from the project root to start . Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8081` to start using mygme!
